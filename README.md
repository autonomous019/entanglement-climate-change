# entanglement-climate-change
This project aims to replicate the the work done in <a href="https://github.com/autonomous019/ahronov-bohm-cybersecurity">Cybersecurity</a> and <a href="https://github.com/autonomous019/entanglement-medicine">Medicine</a> using the same principles of Ahronov-Bohm generators with the application space being climate mitigation, fuel efficiency, cleaner burning coal and other areas researched by Russian, Ukranians and others from the former Soviet Union, which is where the use of A-B generators originated in the Soviet Union. 

<h3>Energy</h3>

Experiments using the Ahronov-Bohm effect and creating Low Energy Nuclear Reactions (LENR) have been done in Russia, there is also the ideal of Baker and Fontana of using gravitational waves to also trigger nuclear fusion. Zhigalov gives this overview in Russian on LENR: 

<ul>
Данный обзор ставит задачу рассмотреть совместно некоторые разрозненные факты, известные в основном только специалистам, работающим в области низкоэнергетических ядерных реакций (Low Energy Nuclear Reactions - LENR). Эти факты в силу различных причин малоизвестны широкой научной общественности. В России активных исследователей в данной области, по-видимому, несколько десятков, а по всему миру несколько сотен. Это совсем немного по сравнению с многочисленной армией физиков-ядерщиков. Для отдельной частной физической темы это, казалось бы, вполне нормально. Однако явление, о котором идёт речь, требует гораздо больших усилий, поскольку несводимо к уже изученным физическим процессам, и, как считают многие, претендует на необходимость пересмотра общепринятых теорий. Кроме того, многие считают, что разработка этой темы сулит человечеству неисчерпаемый безопасный источник энергии.
</ul>

An english overview of LENR is provided with academic citations at https://e-catworld.com/what-is-lenr/

  The high power- and energy density of LENR seems to compare with a nuclear process, and Andrea Rossi is now testing a 1 MW plant which is intended to last for a year without refuelling. If LENR is proved that it works, the cost of energy would likely dramatically drop. LENR has the potential to be the energy source for humanity for the next centuries and may be able to stop the exhaust of CO2 in the atmosphere. (Rossi, E-Cat, 2021)

A Gravitational analog to the A-B approach but based in the Gravitational A-B effect is that of Baker and Fontana, using high frequency gravitational waves to induce nuclear reactions:

<ul>
  If an ultra-high-intensity HFGW flux impinges on a nucleus, it is possible that it could
initiate nuclear fusion at a remote location, or “mass disruption”. Also it may be possible
to create radioactive waste-free nuclear reactions and energy reactions (Fontana. and
Baker, 2007). The fusion reactions active on stars are driven by gravity, so why not
consider a similar process built at a much smaller scale? For instance, non-linear effects
related to HFGWs can be applied to “Gravity Induced Fusion” (GIF). Metric changes at
the atomic scale can emulate the muonic-catalyzed fusion process without the need for
muons (the muon is basically a heavy electron, about 200 times the mass of an electron,
and, like an electron, is also a fundamental, point-like particle, as far as present day
experimental measurements can tell, and has an electric charge identical to that of an
electron). So an HFGW-based GIF process can be described with known theories and
supporting experiments. (Baker, 2010)
  
</ul>

Okatrin worked on Nuclear reactors for the Soviet space program. Nuclear Fusion and Ahronov-Bohm effect is addressed not only in Russian research but also of many gravitational wave theorists around the world such as Italian G. Fontana and American Robert Baker Jr. They have formulated that it is possible to generate low energy nuclear fusion using gravitational waves, as well as generate gravitational waves from nuclear fusion.  If it were not for the electrostatic barrier and is related to the fact that the electrostatic force has a longer range respect to the strong force that drives nuclear processes which prohibits most low energy nuclear reactions we would see nuclear reactions around us all the time.  By using gravitational waves they hope to condense a deuterium atom by 200x, which produces Helium by using  two gravitational beam tuned to same frequency and phase, with an energy for 1ps of 1.47x1020J at a near singularity h=.995, where h is a dimensionless change of distance of two test particles.  They call this Gravity Induced Fusion (GIF) which involves metric changes at the atomic scale can emulate muonic fusion process without need for muons. (Fontana, 2007) This process uses the secondary derivative of HFGWs transport of energy and momentum and therefore exhibit their own gravitational field. One of the effects used in this process is the Christodoulou Effect, Kip Thorne, of which pulses of GWs have ‘memories’ and these memories add up adding energy and momentum additively.  
As explained by Fontana:

<ul>
“The amplitude of the HFGW is quite small, and it is the integration of the large number of periods in the burst that
induces the microscopic system to collapse because of the non-linearity memory effect. The smallness of h<sub>GW</sub> is
also due to the extremely high frequency of the burst we are considering.

</ul>
<ul>
The effect of HFGWs on matter is not limited to the memory effect. If HFGWs interact with a couple of test
particles it induces a temporary increase of the mass of the two test particles because they are affected by vibrations.
When test particles vibrate their energy increases, their mass increases and, if they are free, then their distance
changes. If they are not free, then the dynamics of the system is affected in various ways depending on the
frequency of the HFGWs. Again we stress that if the mass of the electron is increased by a factor of 200, then it is
possible to mimic muon induced fusion, for which experimental knowledge has been already gained. The mass of
the nuclei will also increase, and the slowdown of the relative motion between two nearby nuclei will be
compensated in part by the compression due to the memory effect, at least for the fusion process.” (Fontana, 2007)

<b>Coal</b>

Coherent Coal is claimed to reduce green house gas emmissions according to the work of Russian researchers, as coal is a major power source any additional reduction in using coal is a step in the right direction:

<ul>
  During the experiment about 220000 tons of coal has been burnt up. In the course of the experiment the
emission of CO2, NOx, and SO2 in the atmosphere was evaluated. They entered computer
base of the power station continuously. As a result of the experiment with pulverized-coal
boilers the decrease of CO2 emission for 13%, NOx emission for 16% and SO2 emission for
16% has been obtained. The dynamics of boilers operation improved.
